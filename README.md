#Ignorebot
- Downloads .gitignore files from https://github.com/github/gitignore
- They are appended to your current .gitignore file. If the file isn't there, it'll create one.

##Usage
```bash
ignorebot install [name]
```

##Naming Requirements
- Case sensitive
- They must match the filenames in https://github.com/github/gitignore (minus the .gitignore part)

##Some examples
```bash
ignorebot install Swift
```

```bash
ignorebot install Java
```

```bash
ignorebot install Node
```

```bash
ignorebot install Ruby
```

```bash
ignorebot install Jekyll
```
